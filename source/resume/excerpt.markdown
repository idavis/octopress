I hold a BS in Computer Science from Gonzaga University and was an MS candidate in Computer Science at Temple University specializing in high performance, high availability, fault tolerant cluster computing. I am an open source advocate publishing a number of my own projects and contributing to several others. I host and am an admin for Spokane .NET User Group web site. When not working on my LCD tan, I enjoy playing basketball and tennis.
