I hold a BS in Computer Science from Gonzaga University and was an MS
candidate in Computer Science at Temple University specializing in high
performance, high availability, fault tolerant cluster computing. I am
an open source advocate publishing a number of my own projects and
contributing to several others. I host and am an admin for Spokane .NET
User Group [web site][]. When not working on my LCD tan, I enjoy playing
basketball and tennis.

**Senior Developer**, [PLAYXPERT][] *December 2007 to December 2009*

-   Implemented application capable of being rendered in a game during
    full screen exclusive mode and enable the redirection of input to
    the client application.
-   Implemented continuous integration system, automated testing and
    code analysis.
-   Designed multi-process extension loading system to allow process
    isolation of loaded extensions.
-   Founded and ran SQA in the organization.
-   Created project SQA processes and reported on areas for improvement
    and identified processes that need to be defined.
-   Fixed windows miniport display driver bugs.
-   Team lead for widget development, client development, and kernel
    development teams.
-   Designed and implemented widgets/extensions including VOIP clients,
    RSS feed reader, audio playback, game detection and session
    management, Twitter^TM^, system diagnostics, and more.
-   Implemented several proprietary .NET controls with custom rendering.
-   Held final hiring say for candidates in PLAYXPERT and its consulting
    division.
-   Designed IPC mechanisms for cross application communication.
-   Migrated application to run as a native x64 or win32 application
    depending on environment.
-   Created product installers and bootstrapping installers using
    InstallShield, Setup Factory, and MSI Factory.
-   Created managed wrappers for unmanaged C++ and Delphi APIs and COM
    interop libraries with full x64 and x86 call/structure
    compatibility.
-   Designed game detection markup language grammar and implemented
    token processing system.
-   Hired, trained and mentored the team for writing widgets, designing
    application extension points, writing unit tests, refactoring,
    estimation, and using source control management systems.
-   Performed memory and performance profiling to optimize application
    performance and minimize system impact while in-game.

**Software Developer**, Traffic.com/Navteq/Nokia *May 2006 to November
2007*

-   Performed analysis, design and development of software products
    Nexgen and Jamcast. Nexgen allows for the creation of 2D and 3D
    virtual worlds with live traffic. Jamcast is an automated solution
    that runs twenty-four hours a day using the same data, 2D, and 3D
    worlds as Nexgen, but builds video reports with full audio. Jamcast
    comes in two modes; a television station will have a Jamcast system
    which is composed of a main machine to run the Jamcast application
    as well as a video production machine which processes the video
    output for television and web. The second kind is the Jamcast
    cluster which generate reports for many cities and which are
    available on the Traffic.com web site. The Jamcast cluster is
    written in C\# and C++/CLI and is actually a suite of distributed
    applications working together using raw sockets, http, and .NET
    remoting.
-   Created a build system automating integration builds, unit tests,
    and creation of deployment packages.
-   Demonstrated the effectiveness of test driven development to shorten
    development time and increase product reliability.
-   Identified and removed performance bottlenecks and memory leaks
    through application profiling and analysis.
-   Designed a traffic vocalization system to turn generic traffic data
    into audio.

**Graduate Student**, Temple University *September 2005 to March 2007*

-   Implemented Stateless Parallel Processing Machine (SPPM) prototype
    using .NET technologies including sockets, remoting, named pipes,
    and COM.
-   Designed features and protocols for the SPPM system.
-   Developed a unique, high performance, bidirectional remoting system
    in C\#.
-   Prototyped multi-core parallel markup tag and function to
    parallelize code over multiple cores.
-   Demonstrated the ability to verify the correctness of parallel
    applications without running the executables using aspect oriented
    techniques.
-   Designed a process to simulate a cluster of nodes for the testing of
    parallel applications
