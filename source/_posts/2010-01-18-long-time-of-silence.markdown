It has been quite a while since I last blogged. In usual style, it has been for a reason seen over and over. I changed jobs.

I have started my own software company doing contract .NET development as well as partnering with IntelliTect. It has been very hectic switching from employee to business owner and great experience. Now that things are calming down a bit I anticipate that I will be blogging regularly again.
