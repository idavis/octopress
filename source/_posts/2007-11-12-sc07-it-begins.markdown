Celebrating the 45nm Launch – 45 steps to Technology Leadership
{% endblockquote %}

Ok. So they made 45nm, what’s next? With the physical limit a few nm away (from what I understand, 30nm is the limit), what are they going to shock and awe us with next?

Everyone is trying to get the final touches finished on their booths while eagerly awaiting the food coming in just 5 minutes. After an hour of eating, we will have a half hour break before the VIPs get their privileged two hour private run on the show floor. From what I hear, D-Wave is claiming to have the first quantum computer presented here, but we will have to see about that.
