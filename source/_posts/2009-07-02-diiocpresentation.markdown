This session will cover Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC) and their relationship to SOLID design principles, techniques, and side effects in statically typed languages. In addition, IoC containers, how they work, their usages, patterns, and role as building blocks for loosely coupled applications will be explored.
