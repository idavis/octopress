Well, I have been in Spokane for a week now. I still feel like I am just settling in. My car finally shipped (thanks to MN for helping) and should arrive this week. The contents of my apt may not be here until Christmas, so it will be a little rough until then. The weather the last two weekends has been as bad as the worst I saw in Philadelphia (and it is only December). I wish I could find reliable information on what are the best winter tires.
