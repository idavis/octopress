Yesterday I released version [0.4](https://github.com/downloads/idavis/Ensurance/Ensurance-bin-0.4.zip) on <del>Codeplex</del> GitHub. All of the functionality for the 1.0 release is finished. I am trying to wrap up all of the tasks needed for a distribution. When all of that is done I will mark the release as 1.0. I am still looking for functionality ideas.
