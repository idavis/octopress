That’s right! We have officially released Ninject 1.5 and 2.0! [Ninject 2.0](http://ninject.org/) has been in beta for exactly one year and we are very happy to announce its release. You can download the binaries from the Ninject.org web site. Expect more posts here and on Nate’s blog with more information.

Over the next couple weeks we will be releasing the extensions projects based on the official 2.0 release for all available platforms. The [1.5 wiki](https://github.com/ninject/ninject1/wiki/) is up and the [2.0 wiki](https://github.com/ninject/ninject/wiki/) documentation is in process including changes between the versions.

Nate has the official announcement out!
