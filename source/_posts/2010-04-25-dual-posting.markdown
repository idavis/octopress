I will be making blog posts to more than one blog from now on. If you take a look at the [IntelliTect](http://www.intellitect.com/) [blog](http://www.intellitect.com/blog/) you can use the [main feed](http://www.intellitechture.com/feed/rss/) or [my personalized feed](http://www.intellitechture.com/author/ian-davis/feed/rss/) to see my blog posts that are not posted here. I just blogged on [Parallel.For where i does not go to i++](http://www.intellitechture.com/parallel-for-where-i-does-not-go-to-i/) in which I create an iterator to allow us to move forward, backward, skip, and use a wide variety of types in our sequences.
