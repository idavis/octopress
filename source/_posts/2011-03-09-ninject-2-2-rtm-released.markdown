If you havenâ€™t heard already, Ninject 2.2 is out the door. You can download all of the extensions from a few different places.

+ Their respective [GitHub pages](https://github.com/ninject)
+ Via [NuGet](http://nuget.org/Packages/Search?packageType=Packages&searchCategory=All+Categories&searchTerm=Ninject)
+ Off of the [build server](http://teamcity.codebetter.com/project.html?projectId=project3&tab=projectOverview) if you always want the latest.

The guys at [PlanetGeek.ch](http://planetgeek.ch), especially [Remo](http://www.planetgeek.ch/author/remo-gloor/) and [Daniel](http://www.planetgeek.ch/author/danielmarbach/) have been huge in getting the 2.2 release done. Thank you so much. If you are not following these guys, you are missing a fair bit of Ninject goodness.
