I have been incredibly busy lately and thus there have been no posts. I have finally published the first release of my project [Ensurance](https://github.com/idavis/Ensurance) on <del>CodePlex</del> GitHub. It is based on the NUnit 2.4.3 framework and is intended to be used for production code to verify particular constraints in an application. Check out the <del>CodePlex</del> GitHub page for more information.
