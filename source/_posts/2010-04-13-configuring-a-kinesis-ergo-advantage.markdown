<p>I had to reset my keyboard and I had forgotten the setup that I need to do in order to get it configured the way I like it. In case anyone else ever wants to set theirs up, here is mine:</p>
<ul>
<li>To disable tones used by Caps Lock, Keypad, and others, hold down Progrm and press the hyphen (-) key. Repeat to turn then back on.</li>
<li>To disable key click audio hold down Progrm and press the Backslash key (“”) located just below the hyphen key)</li>
<li>Remapping embedded Insert key to top layer (This is critical for ReSharper):<br />
If you would like to remap the embedded Insert key to the top layer, follow these instructions:<br />
1). Turn Keypad On.<br />
2). Press and hold the Progrm key and tap F12 (LED&#8217;s on keyboard will flash rapidly).<br />
3). Press and release the &#8220;Insert&#8221; key (LED&#8217;s will slow down).<br />
4). Press and release the Keypad key.<br />
5). Press and release the Insert key again (LED&#8217;s will speed up).<br />
6). Exit by repeating step 2 (LED&#8217;s will stop flashing).</li>
<li>Hold &#8216;=&#8217; and press &#8216;w&#8217; in a text editor. Hold &#8216;=&#8217; and press &#8216;s&#8217; and you should see:<br />
v3.1[SL K H e ] or v3.2[SL K H e ]<br />
- Thumb key modifier keys are optimized for Windows<br />
- Keypad = is the same as Number row =<br />
- Scroll lock performs scroll lock action<br />
- Keyboard stays awake when computer sleeps setting is active<br />
- Fast mouse speed is set on</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use whatever macros you like, but this setup is most conducive to my workflow.</p>
