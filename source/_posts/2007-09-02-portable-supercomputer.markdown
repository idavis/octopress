The story of the Calvin College portable supercomputer really irks me. It is getting a lot of attention for doing nothing. You can see it on [engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/02/calvin-college-duo-creates-cheap-portable-supercomputer/), [Slashdot](http://hardware.slashdot.org/hardware/07/08/31/0235242.shtml), and others. Anyone can build a cluster like what they have. The only credit I will give them is that not everyone would go through the benchmark and analysis as they did. On the other hand, these people are still on the same old trail of HPC. They ignore the entire issue of programming — they used HPL code. Ask if they can write their own code for the microwolf. What kind of real application performance can they achieve? The engadget article says “Talk about a solid price-to-performance ratio.” – what load of crap. How about asking real questions and reporting real HPC news?
