Michael Suess from [Thinking Parallel](http://www.thinkingparallel.com/) was kind enough to point me to a paper he coauthored “[Implementing Irregular Parallel Algorithms with OpenMP](http://www.michaelsuess.net/publications/suess_leopold_irregular_para_06.pdf)“. In it he goes on to describe a way to implement the early thread sync that I mentioned using OpenMP. If you are interested in more of his papers, here is his [publications page](http://www.michaelsuess.net/publications.php).
