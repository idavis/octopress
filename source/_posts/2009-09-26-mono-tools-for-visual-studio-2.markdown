I have been waiting for [this](http://go-mono.com/monovs/Default.aspx) for a long time. There is a private preview for tools that will allow you to write .NET apps and port your code at the same time. It looks like they integrated the compatibility analyzer, remote Linux debugger, packaging system and local mono debugging into Visual Studio. It is too bad this didnâ€™t come out while I was writing code for Linux.
