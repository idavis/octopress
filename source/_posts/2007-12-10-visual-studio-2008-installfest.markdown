I will be attending the [Visual Studio 2008 InstallFest](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&EventID=1032360766) in Spokane Valley on Wednesday the 12th with a few other developers from PLAYXPERT. It will be nice to meet some other .NET coders in the Spokane area. Hopefully we can pick something up soon (better SIGS). I was really looking forward to attending the Agile Philly and Philly ALT.NET group meetings before the move to Spokane.
