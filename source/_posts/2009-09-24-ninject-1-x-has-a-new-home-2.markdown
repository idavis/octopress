<p>The <a href="http://github.com/ninject/ninject1">Ninject 1.X</a> repository has been migrated to GitHub; However, this version is only receiving critical bug fixes, all new development is being done on the <a href="http://github.com/ninject/ninject">Ninject 2.0</a> codebase. We will be releasing 1.5 pretty soon, so if you need to use <a href="http://github.com/ninject/ninject1">Ninject 1.X</a> for compatibility, keep an ear open.</p>
