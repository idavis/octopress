Code Pyre is idea that code that will someday be burned in effigy on its own pyre. All code dies, and with the old code dying, we remember where we were and where we are going. More importantly, we remember why we write code: a burning passion we share with others to create for the sake of creation.

Code Pyre is brought to you by the dedication of passionate programmers in hope that you can add your code to the pyre someday.
